## Getting Started
1. Install requirements. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

2. Download data. You can download all the datasets from [Autoformer](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy). 

3. Training. All the scripts are in the directory ```.scripts```.  If you want to obtain the results of **input-96-predict-96** on the Weather dataset, you can run the following command:
```
sh scripts/long_term_forecast/Weather/weather_96.sh
```
