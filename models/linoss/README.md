# Oscillatory State-Space Models (ICLR2025 Oral)

This  repository contains the official implementation for the paper [Oscillatory State-Space Models](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=GRMfXcAAFh) by [T. Konstantin Rusch](https://konstantinrusch.com/) and [Daniela Rus](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/daniela-rus).

This repository is an extension of [https://github.com/Benjamin-Walker/log-neural-cdes](https://github.com/Benjamin-Walker/log-neural-cdes). 

--------------------
We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model.

## Requirements

This repository is implemented in python 3.10 and uses Jax as their machine learning framework.

### Environment

The code for preprocessing the datasets, training LinOSS, S5, LRU, NCDE, NRDE, and Log-NCDE uses the following packages:
- `jax` and `jaxlib` for automatic differentiation.
- `equinox` for constructing neural networks.
- `optax` for neural network optimisers.
- `diffrax` for differential equation solvers.
- `signax` for calculating the signature.
- `sktime` for handling time series data in ARFF format.
- `tqdm` for progress bars.
- `matplotlib` for plotting.
- `pre-commit` for code formatting.

```
conda create -n LinOSS python=3.10
conda activate LinOSS
conda install pre-commit=3.7.1 sktime=0.30.1 tqdm=4.66.4 matplotlib=3.8.4 -c conda-forge
# Substitue for correct Jax pip install: https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
pip install -U "jax[cuda12]" "jaxlib[cuda12]" equinox==0.11.4 optax==0.2.2 diffrax==0.5.1 signax==0.1.1
```

If running `data_dir/process_uea.py` throws this error: No module named 'packaging'
Then run: `pip install packaging`

After installing the requirements, run `pre-commit install` to install the pre-commit hooks.

## Data

The folder `data_dir` contains the scripts for downloading data, preprocessing the data, and creating dataloaders and 
datasets. Raw data should be downloaded into the `data_dir/raw` folder. Processed data should be saved into the `data_dir/processed`
folder in the following format: 
```
processed/{collection}/{dataset_name}/data.pkl, 
processed/{collection}/{dataset_name}/labels.pkl,
processed/{collection}/{dataset_name}/original_idxs.pkl (if the dataset has original data splits)
```
where data.pkl and labels.pkl are jnp.arrays with shape (n_samples, n_timesteps, n_features) 
and (n_samples, n_classes) respectively. If the dataset had original_idxs then those should
be saved as a list of jnp.arrays with shape [(n_train,), (n_val,), (n_test,)].

### The UEA Datasets

The UEA datasets are a collection of multivariate time series classification benchmarks. They can be downloaded by 
running `data_dir/download_uea.py` and preprocessed by running `data_dir/process_uea.py`.

### The PPG-DaLiA Dataset

The PPG-DaLiA dataset is a multivariate time series regression dataset,
where the aim is to predict a personâ€™s heart rate using data
collected from a wrist-worn device. The dataset can be downloaded from the 
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/495/ppg+dalia">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. The data should be 
unzipped and saved in the `data_dir/raw` folder in the following format `PPG_FieldStudy/S{i}/S{i}.pkl`. The data can be
preprocessed by running the `process_ppg.py` script.

---

## Experiments

The code for training and evaluating the models is contained in `train.py`. Experiments can be run using the `run_experiment.py` script. 
This script requires you to specify the names of the models you want to train, 
the names of the datasets you want to train on, and a directory which contains configuration files. By default,
it will run the LinOSS experiments. The configuration files should be organised as `config_dir/{model_name}/{dataset_name}.json` and contain the
following fields:
- `seeds`: A list of seeds to use for training.
- `data_dir`: The directory containing the data.
- `output_parent_dir`: The directory to save the output.
- `lr_scheduler`: A function which takes the learning rate and returns the new learning rate.
- `num_steps`: The number of steps to train for.
- `print_steps`: The number of steps between printing the loss.
- `batch_size`: The batch size.
- `metric`: The metric to use for evaluation.
- `classification`: Whether the task is a classification task.
- `linoss_discretization`: ONLY for LinoSS -- which discretization to use. Choices are ['IM','IMEX']
- `lr`: The initial learning rate.
- `time`: Whether to include time as a channel.
- Any further specific model parameters. 

See `experiment_configs/repeats` for examples.

## Reproducing the Results

The configuration files for all the experiments with fixed hyperparameters can be found in the `experiment_configs` folder and
`run_experiment.py` is currently configured to run the repeat experiments on the UEA datasets.
The `outputs` folder contains a zip file of the output files from the UEA, and PPG experiments.
